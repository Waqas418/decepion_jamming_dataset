# radar_jamming_recognition_dataset
The code will help to generate RF maps of different deception jamming techniques 

***How to save the samples*****
1.	In each simulation code , press (ctrl+r) to enable the save path as shown in example below 
Add the path to save the samples 
%filename=fullfile(folderPath,sprintf('Spectrogram_Real_Part_Sample_%d.png',i;
% saveas(gcf, filename);

2.	Add your path to save as I have mentioned the save path as 
folderPath = 'L:\JS_1_LFM_JAMMING_Samples_RIPM\Real'
replace  'L:\JS_1_LFM_JAMMING_Samples_RIPM\Real' with your path
